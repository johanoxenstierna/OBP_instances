# OBP_instances
Order Batching Problem instances on a modified TSPLIB format and proposed solutions and visualizations using the SBI optimizer. 

##Pictures
The solution folders include pictures. The red and blue diamonds denote destination and origin locations respectively
. The dots denote product and their colors denote the order which the products belong to. Note colors are picked
 randomly from a list so it is often the case that two orders share the same color. In most cases there is one .png
  per batch
, but in some
 cases all batches are
 shown in a single .png (to reduce memory usage). In the latter case it is usually very difficult to make out one
  batch from another.
